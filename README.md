# Atlas

Atlas is a directory of neighbor **websites, blogs, and portfolios**. 

The goal is to inspire creative individuals **to create and maintain their own personal website**, and share traffic organically among each other.

## Joining the webring

1. Add the following icon to your website.
2. Add your website to the [HTML](https://github.com/atlasnesos/atlasnesos.github.io/blob/master/index.html) file. Keep the name short, and donâ€™t leave trailing `/` in the `href` attribute. Use a sensible alphanumeric value as the `id` in your link.
3. Submit a Pull Request with **the location of the webring icon on your site**.

```html
<a href="https://atlasnesos.space/#your-id-here" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
  <img src="https://atlasnesos.space/atlas-black-transparent.svg" alt="Atlas webring"/>
</a>
```

If your website has a dark background, you can use the white icon: `https://atlasnesos.space/atlas-white-transparent.svg`. And if your website is complaining about this link, you can host the icon yourself.

The idea came from [XXIIVV's webring](https://github.com/XXIIVV/webring#join-the-webring) and [Unnoffice Hours webring](https://github.com/websmyth/unoffice-hours-webring).
